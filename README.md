# Raid Ledger

Weekly M+ accountability system for WoW CE progression guilds.
Track every raider every week. Flag who's behind, why, and whether it's a pattern.

## What It Does

- Automatically pulls M+ data from Raider.io after weekly reset
- Evaluates each raider against configurable weekly requirements
- Three-state verdicts: Pass / Fail / Flag (needs officer attention)
- Tracks failure patterns over time (chronic underperformers, streaks)
- Officer dashboard with full roster management, notes, and manual overrides

## Database

Six tables: `players`, `weekly_benchmarks`, `weekly_snapshots`, `officer_notes`, `collection_runs`, `settings`.

- SQLite for local development (zero config)
- PostgreSQL (Supabase) for production via `DATABASE_URL` env var
- All foreign keys use `ON DELETE RESTRICT` — players are deactivated, never deleted

## Raider.io API

The client fetches data from two Raider.io endpoints (free, no auth required, 200 req/min):

**Character profile** — weekly M+ data for collection:
- `mythic_plus_previous_weekly_highest_level_runs` — finalized runs from the completed week
- `gear.item_level_equipped` — ilvl snapshot
- `mythic_plus_scores_by_season` — M+ score

**Guild profile** — roster import:
- Returns all guild members with name, realm, class, spec, role, and rank
- Officers select active raiders from the full member list

Collection runs Tuesday evening (3 hours after US reset) to ensure data is finalized. The client uses exponential backoff on 429 rate limits and retries on timeouts.

## Collection & Rules Engine

### How Collection Works

1. Loads the active roster (core + trial players)
2. Loads the benchmark for this week (copies the most recent one if none is set)
3. For each player: fetches data from Raider.io, evaluates against the benchmark, upserts a snapshot
4. Logs collection run metadata (status, counts, errors)

Collection is safe to re-run — `UNIQUE(player_id, week_of)` upserts mean the latest data wins.

### How the Rules Engine Evaluates

OR-logic: failing ANY active check = failed week. All thresholds come from the weekly benchmark — nothing is hardcoded.

- **Pass**: Met all requirements
- **Fail**: `INSUFFICIENT_KEYS` (runs at level < minimum) and/or `LOW_ILVL` (ilvl < minimum, only checked when set)
- **Flag**: `NO_DATA` (API returned nothing — needs officer review)

Vault slots are derived from M+ count: 1/4/8 runs = 1/2/3 slots.

### Running Collection Manually

```bash
python scripts/collect_weekly.py                    # current week
python scripts/collect_weekly.py --week 2026-03-17  # specific week
```

## Analysis

The analyzer detects failure patterns across weeks. All thresholds are configurable parameters.

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `get_weekly_summary(week_of)` | All players' pass/fail/flag for a week, sorted flags-first |
| `get_player_history(player_id, weeks)` | Per-player timeline, most recent first |
| `get_failure_rate(player_id, lookback)` | "Failed X of last N" — flags excluded, short history respected |
| `get_chronic_underperformers(threshold, lookback)` | Active players who failed >= threshold of last N weeks |
| `get_current_streaks()` | Consecutive pass/fail streak per active player |
| `get_failure_breakdown(week_of)` | Count by failure reason for a week |
| `get_trial_flags(lookback)` | Trial players with any failures in their first N weeks |

Default thresholds (configurable via Settings): chronic = 3 failures in 5 weeks, streak warning at 2.

## Dashboard

Run locally with `streamlit run dashboard/app.py`. Password gate via `st.secrets` (no secret = open access for local dev).

- **Weekly Overview**: Color-coded roster table (flags first, then fails, then passes). CSV export. First-run onboarding card when no data exists.
- **Player Timeline**: Per-player 12-week heatmap strip, M+ score trend line, per-week detail cards with reasons and officer notes.

All status indicators use icons + text + color (never color alone) for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

## Configuration

`config/default.toml` provides seed values. After first run, the database `settings` table is the source of truth. All settings are editable through the dashboard Settings page.
